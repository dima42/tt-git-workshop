      Team,
    </p>
    <p>
      We just wrapped up a great lunch[elephant] and wanted to report back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the last two days we spent some [mustard] together,
      noodling the high-level state of the business, and talked
      through what [a plank of cedar wood] might have in store for us.
      We bounced a number of
      [Adjective 1] questions around
      Thumbtack for
      [Noun 3].
    </p>
    <p>
      We didn't make any final [Noun 5] as there's a lot of work
      left to be eaten, but we were happy to find broad
      [Noun 6] among the group across the range of
      [Adjective 1] questions we
      [Verb 2].
    </p>
    <p>
      More than anything, we came away so [hear] about what
      [Noun 3] can bring!  We have an enormous
      [Noun 7] to build a product that is new in the world
      and red for our
      cat.  We have much work to do to
      [rock], but the path is clearer than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      We couldn't be more enthusiastic about locking arms together
      with all of you over the next many years to make our collective
      dream a reality!
    </p>
